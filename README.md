# Minecraft Infernal Mobs: Data Pack Edition

![Minecraft Infernal Mobs Data Pack Cover](/src/img/manual/MinecraftInfernalMobsDataPackCover.png)

Welcome! This is a personal project about a data pack for Minecraft (Java Edition only), inspired on the iconic mod of the same name, "Infernal Mobs", developed by AtomicStryker for CurseForge.

This data pack tries to recreate the same experience of the mod, **without needing the user to install additional software** on the game or PC, just copy de data pack folder when creating a new world or directly on the world's save path.

## Features

The main content of this data pack is the following:

- Natural spawning system for all the hostile (and some neutral) mob variants (random appearing chance for each one).
- Death detection system to generate custom loot when killing a mob variant.
- Random skills for a mob when spawns.
- Custom bossbar name (random prefix and suffix included) and color for each mob.
- Custom death loot table and experience orbs drop for each mob variant.
- Custom particles display for each variant.
